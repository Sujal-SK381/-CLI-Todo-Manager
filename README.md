# -CLI-Todo-Manager
A simple and powerful command-line interface (CLI) application to manage your to-do tasks. This Python project allows you to add tasks, set priorities, and assign due dates. You can also mark tasks as completed, delete or edit existing tasks, and view overdue tasks. All tasks are saved persistently to a text file for future use.
